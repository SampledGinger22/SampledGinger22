ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Mason, a passionate software engineer with a focus on leveraging C# and SQL-based databases to solve complex challenges. Over the last couple years, I've honed my skills in reverse engineering, dissecting programs and APIs to understand their inner workings, and creating usable data objects gathered from their databases. 

My expertise lies in structuring code to bridge the gap between disparate third-party data sources and internal APIs, ensuring seamless integration and accessibility. Whether it's transforming data formats or optimizing processes, I thrive on finding elegant solutions to technical puzzles.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, building financial models in excel for fun, or playing some games. Let's connect and collaborate on building innovative solutions together!
